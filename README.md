* client and server both will run in two different IP addresses.
* client and server will send messages to each other after getting connected.
2. Program to run UDP client and server socket program [Link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Computer_Networking/tree/master/assignment_2)
* client and server both will run in two different IP addresses.
* server will broadcast messages to all.
3. Program using TCP socket to implement [Link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Computer_Networking/tree/master/assignment_3)
* server maintains records of fruits in the format: fruit-name quantity Last sold (server timestamp)
* multiple client purchase the fruits one at a time.
* the fruit quantity is updated each time any fruit is sold.
* show warning messages to the client if the quantity requested is not available.
4. Write a file transfer program for TCP client and server [Link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Computer_Networking/tree/master/assignment_4)
* files should be uploaded and downloaded by the client.
* calculate the time required to download.
* change the download/upload rate of a given file.
5. Redo the 4th assignment using UDP client and server [Link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Computer_Networking/tree/master/assignment_5)

6. Given a text file with 10 sentences as input, write a client server C program where client encrypts the text file using bitwise operations (as a key) at the client side and sends the encrypted file to the server. Server program will take the key as the input and will decrypt the original file. [Link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Computer_Networking/tree/master/assignment_6) 

7. Write a TCP client and server socket program to do the followings: [Link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Computer_Networking/tree/master/assignment_7)
* Server maintains a scientific calculator function.
* Client passes string like 3+5, 5*6, sin30 etc and get reply from the server as the result.
8. Write a UDP client server chat broadcast program to implement the following: [Link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Computer_Networking/tree/master/assignment_8)
* Each client will use a username and will send message any particular client (using username) or to UDP server
* UDP server keeps central chat box which display all the messages received by it from different clients
* A client will display the message sent to it by matching its username in the received data
9. Write an OpenFlow controller program to implement a L2 and L3 firewall. (Use mininet to create a simple topology) [Link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Computer_Networking/tree/master/assignment_9)

10. Write a program for multi-threaded chat program in Java/Python. [Link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Computer_Networking/tree/master/assignment_10)
